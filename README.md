# Analyzing-Car-Sales
About the project
As an avid enthusiast of both data analysis and the automotive industry, I have dedicated my leisure time to analyzing car sales data. This hobby combines my passion for numbers with my interest in understanding market dynamics. By meticulously tracking sales figures, market trends, and consumer preferences, I gain insights into the ever-evolving landscape of the automotive market.

Through this hobby, I have developed strong analytical skills that allow me to identify patterns, correlations, and anomalies within large datasets. I apply statistical methods to draw meaningful conclusions that offer valuable insights into customer behavior, popular models, and emerging market trends. Utilizing tools such as Excel, and data visualization platforms power bi, I create comprehensive reports and visual representations that showcase my findings to a wider audience.
